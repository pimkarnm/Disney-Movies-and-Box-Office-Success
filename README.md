# Disney Movies and Box Office Success Project

**Project Description**

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. 
While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. 
This project will analyze data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. 
Also, perform hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.

This project contains steps to manipulate data using pandas and make basic plots using Seaborn as well as 
utilize statistical inference to perform two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for the difference of means.

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the Disney Character Success dataset from [Kelly Garrett](https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16).
